Project Title
Heart Disease Risk Predictor â€“ Smart Diagnosis Through Data

Objective
This project aims to assist healthcare professionals and individuals in identifying the likelihood of heart disease based on medical attributes. Using a machine learning-based predictive model, it evaluates key health indicators to provide an accurate risk assessment.

Features
User-friendly interface for uploading or entering patient data

Predicts heart disease risk based on clinical parameters

Displays prediction result with probability score

Highlights most influential features (like cholesterol, age, etc.)

Generates visualizations (correlation heatmap, feature importance)

Summarizes prediction results in a text-based report

Option to save predictions and reports locally for records

Tools and Libraries

Python 3.x serves as the core development language.
The project uses:

pandas and numpy for data handling

scikit-learn for model training and evaluation

matplotlib and seaborn for visual analytics

joblib for saving and loading the model

os and json for file operations
A simple CLI-based interface manages user interaction and reporting.

|------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Explore dataset, define features, and clean/preprocess the data     |
| 2    | Train baseline model (Random Forest), evaluate performance          |
| 3    | Add visualizations (heatmaps, feature importance)                   |
| 4    | Build CLI for input/prediction, add report generation               |
| 5    | Improve model accuracy, add error handling and polish UI            |
| 6    | Prepare pitch deck, code documentation, and optional demo video     |
