Project Title  
             Smart Expense Tracker – Track, Analyze, and Save**  

 Objective  
This project aims to help individuals manage their personal finances by tracking expenses, analyzing spending habits, and suggesting ways to save money — all through a simple, smart, and user-friendly Python-based tool.  



 Features  
- A user-friendly CLI (or optional web interface) to log income and expenses  
- Automatically categorizes expenses into categories like Food, Transport, Bills, etc.  
- Generates monthly and weekly reports with charts  
- Lets users set and track budget goals  
- Provides notifications or suggestions when overspending is detected  
- Can export reports as PDF or CSV  
- Keeps data secure and private on the user’s machine, with an optional cloud storage feature  

Tools and Libraries  
Python 3.x will be used as the core language.  
The project will use pandas for data management, matplotlib or seaborn for creating charts and analytics, and rich or tqdm to make the CLI more interactive.  
ReportLab or FPDF will be used to generate PDF reports, and sqlite3 will handle local data storage.  
An optional web version can be built using Flask or Streamlit.

Bonus Challenge  
A pitch deck is planned with slides covering the problem, solution, features, demo screens, and tech stack.  
UI mockups and an architecture diagram will also be created using Figma or draw.io.  
A short 1-minute pitch video is optional but considered.  


Notes  
This document is the main deliverable for the Capstone Planning stage.  
Any bonus materials like the pitch deck, mockups, or video will also be added to the Capstone folder when ready.
