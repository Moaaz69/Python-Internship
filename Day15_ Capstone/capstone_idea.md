🩺 Project Title
Heart Disease Risk Predictor – Smart Diagnosis Through Data

🎯 Objective
This project is designed to assist both healthcare professionals and individuals in predicting the risk of heart disease using clinical data. By leveraging a machine learning model, the tool provides a data-driven assessment based on key medical attributes, supporting early diagnosis and preventive action.

⚙️ Features
🧾 Simple CLI interface for entering or uploading patient data

🧠 Predicts heart disease likelihood based on medical indicators

📊 Displays prediction result along with a probability score

📌 Highlights top contributing factors (e.g., cholesterol, age, ST slope)

🌡️ Visualizations like correlation heatmap and feature importance plots

📝 Generates a clear, text-based prediction report

💾 Option to save predictions and reports locally for recordkeeping

🧰 Tools & Libraries
Built using Python 3.x, the project utilizes:

pandas, numpy – for data manipulation

scikit-learn – for model training & evaluation

matplotlib, seaborn – for data visualization

joblib – to save/load ML models

os, json – for file operations

A custom Command-Line Interface for seamless user interaction

| Week | Tasks                                                                |
|------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Explore dataset, define features, and clean/preprocess the data     |
| 2    | Train baseline model (Random Forest), evaluate performance          |
| 3    | Add visualizations (heatmaps, feature importance)                   |
| 4    | Build CLI for input/prediction, add report generation               |
| 5    | Improve model accuracy, add error handling and polish UI            |
| 6    | Prepare pitch deck, code documentation, and optional demo video     |
