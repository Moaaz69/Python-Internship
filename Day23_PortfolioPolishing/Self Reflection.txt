
My Python Internship Journey at ProSensia 

Over the past weeks, I’ve completed the ProSensia Python Internship, working on real-world projects from data analysis and automation to machine learning and API integration.

Here’s what I learned:

Python Fundamentals: Improved my coding style, OOP, and modular design.

Data Science: Used pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn for data cleaning and visualization.

APIs & Automation: Built CLI tools and integrated public APIs for real-time data.

Machine Learning: Developed a heart disease prediction model and learned about feature importance and model evaluation.

Testing & Debugging: Practiced writing unit tests and robust error handling.

Deployment: Deployed apps online and wrote clear documentation for users.


Challenges:
Debugging, learning new libraries quickly, and making my code user-friendly.

What’s Next:
I’m excited to keep building, learning, and contributing to open-source!
